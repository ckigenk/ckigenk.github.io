I specialize in bacterial and viral genomics, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance and phage therapy. Currently serving as Head of Genomics and Bioinformatics at KEMRI/WRAIR-Africa, supporting a national research initiative to characterize bacterial genomes and identify the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance across Kenya.

Proficient in whole genome sequencing using Illumina (NextSeq 1000) and Oxford Nanopore platforms, as well as bioinformatics analysis using command-line tools, Python, and R. Academic background includes an ongoing MSc in Molecular Medicine, a BSc in Medical Biochemistry, and a certificate in Clinical Bacteriology from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

Completed advanced bioinformatics training at the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC BDRD), USA, and participated in the 2023 NGS and Bioinformatics Workshop at USAMRD-A, Kenya. Co-author of 14 peer-reviewed scientific publications. Experienced instructor with a strong commitment to capacity building, having facilitated over seven bioinformatics courses and trained more than 250 participants as a certified Data Carpentry Instructor.
